description:
I have a robot which:
* Is primarily a cylindrical profile with a radius of about 0.44m, a height of 0.3m, and a mass of 22kg.
* Has a 2-wheel differential drive and a rear caster wheel.
* There are a few temperature sensors at various places on the robot, at least one of which can measure ambient temperature.
* Has 2 IMU sensors, at opposing ends of the robot, one mounted upside down relative to the other so that the rate gyroscopes somewhat cancel each other’s static drift.
* Has one LIDAR sensor mounted at the top front of the robot with a viewing angle of about 270 degrees. I could add another LIDAR near the top of a 4-foot pole which is attached to the top, back of the robot.
* Has a gripper assembly consisting of the 4-foot pole with a band which can move, acting as an elevator, an 18-inch  arm attached at one end of the 18-inch arm at a right angle to the elevator, the arm can extend an additional 18 inches, a two-fingered, parallel gripper that can open and shut at the end of the extendible arm.
* There is a 2K camera mounted a bit behind and above the extendible gripper for helping position the gripper for grasping an object and determining when an object has been grasped.
* Encoders are attached to each wheel to provide wheel odometry. Of course, there is some amount of slippage for each wheel when the robot moves.
* Atop the 4-foot pole is another camera, an OAK-D which can generate RGB and point cloud images. It can also run AI models that, e.g., produce segmentation of the image, or do object recognition.
* Has a PC running Linux 24.04 and also running the ROS2 framework/jazzy distribution. The navigation2 stack currently runs and uses the IMUs, odometry, and LIDAR topics for computing SLAM.  The robot is capable of generating and following a plan to move the robot to a given pose in the house. There is some amount of chance of failure when trying to execute the plan, so the goal is abandoned somewhat frequently when the global planner thinks it can’t find a plan forward. Usually, if you request to move the robot again to the same goal, it will succeed. The PC can connect to the local network via Wi-Fi. There is an additional desktop, Linux computer available for additional computing and can be reached via Wi-Fi.
* The robot can run for several hours on a single battery charge, probably 6 or more hours at a time.
* There currently isn’t any automatic way to recharge the battery. I have to plug in the charger manually, but there will be a way for the robot to find a charging station and attach itself. It will probably take one to two hours to recharge.
* I have a static map which was manually drawn from the blueprints for the house. It does not include furniture except for an area for the kitchen table. The house has narrow doorways for the master bedroom, the music room, the guest bedroom, the computer room, and the hobby room. The kitchen and living room have a hallway connecting them. There is a grand hallway from the master bedroom to the guest bathroom to the music room to the guest bedroom, and across from the guest bedroom is the computer room. The living room exits to both the kitchen and the hobby room. The grand hallway is 3 feet wide. The doorways are a combination of 2 feet wide and 30 inches wide, making it a bit hard for the robot to move through.
* I have created a database of where the walls are in the house, giving the starting x and y position, the length, and width of the wall. The length and width can indicate if the wall is east-west or north-south oriented. This database was intended to be available if I want to write some code that would interpret the LIDAR readings to attempt to find wall locations that the LIDAR can see and make a guess as to which room the robot is in and the position in the room. This would be used to override SLAM localization as sometimes the robot will get its location wrong using the SLAM toolbox. The AMCL node in ROS2 is prone to delocalization now and then when roaming along one or two places in the house.

What I want to do is write some sort of code package to cause the robot to roam the house, particularly when we are out of the house. The robot should look for interesting changes to the house, like something has fallen over, chairs are moved, exit doors are open, or the house is unusually warm or cold. When something of interest is detected, the robot will send an e-mail to us.

First, I want to determine what would be a good way to write the roaming code. The two obvious choices are using behavior trees which are well integrated into ROS2, but then I need to decide on a bunch of feature recognizers to write code to be used by the behavior tree, like, “battery charge percentage”, “is door detected”, “is in grand hallway”, “distance moved in last time period” or whatever else we can think of to detect not only where the robot should go but whether or not safety has been violated.The second obvious choice is to just write heuristic code, probably with a state machine, to roam a fixed distance from walls, detect doorways, avoid dynamic obstacles, and so on.
Do a deep search to see if there are obvious solutions to my problem that others have tried which can guide my solution. Then I want a suggestion as to what is the best way to approach this problem. Once we have a back and forth discussion about how to solve this problem, I will come back and ask a more refined question about how to begin programming the solution. Feel free to ask questions to help you solve this.
