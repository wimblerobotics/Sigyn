# TODO
* Predicte battery discharge time based on current draw. Signal 'needs charging' earlier. Signal system_fault when critical.
* Implement IsUnsafe, ResetSafetyFlags for battery.
* Board1 should pick up roboclaw temp, motor1 current, motor2 current, etc.
* Battery message is not showing capacity for LIPO. Is there a field for 'is charging'?
