2. **Error Level**: Reduce non-critical functionality, notify ROS2 system
3. **Critical Level**: Trigger controlled shutdown, activate E-stop if necessary

## Motor Control Optimization

### RoboClawMonitor Performance Architecture

The RoboClawMonitor has been extensively optimized for high-frequency odometry and responsive motor control, implementing a tiered execution model based on the legacy roboclaw_module.cpp design:

#### Execution Frequency Tiers

**Tier 1: High-Frequency Operations (≥70Hz)**
- **Encoder Reading**: Direct read of both motor encoders for odometry calculation
- **Odometry Calculation**: Real-time pose and velocity computation with microsecond timestamps
- **Cmd_vel Processing**: Velocity command processing with up to 67Hz rate limiting
- **Execution Time**: 2-4ms per cycle (includes encoder I/O and calculations)

**Tier 2: Medium-Frequency Operations (~30Hz)**  
- **Motor Status Monitoring**: Speed readings and basic system health checks
- **Safety Checks**: Overcurrent detection and runaway motor monitoring
- **Execution Time**: 1-2ms per cycle (spread across multiple loop iterations)

**Tier 3: Low-Frequency Operations (~3Hz)**
- **System Diagnostics**: Voltage, current, and temperature readings
- **Error Status**: RoboClaw error register monitoring  
- **Status Reporting**: JSON-formatted status messages to ROS2
- **Execution Time**: <1ms per cycle (minimal impact on real-time performance)

#### Odometry Performance

**High-Frequency Odometry Updates:**
- **Update Rate**: 70-85Hz (limited by encoder read speed, not computation)
- **Latency**: <15ms from wheel movement to ODOM message publication
- **Precision**: 3 decimal places for position (millimeter accuracy)
- **Integration Method**: Midpoint integration for improved accuracy over time
- **Data Freshness**: Encoder values read immediately before each odometry calculation

**Optimization Techniques:**
- **Direct Encoder Access**: Bypasses state machine for critical odometry reads
- **Minimal Computation**: Optimized trigonometric calculations
- **Reduced Message Overhead**: Compact ODOM message format
- **Smart Rate Limiting**: Only publishes when meaningful motion detected

#### Motor Command Processing

**Responsive Command Handling:**
- **Command Rate**: Up to 67Hz for velocity commands (15ms intervals)
- **Significant Change Detection**: Only sends commands when motor speeds change >10 QPPS
- **Force Updates**: Periodic updates every 100ms to maintain control authority
- **Timeout Protection**: Automatic motor stop after 200ms without commands

**Control Flow Optimization:**
- **Bypass State Machine**: Critical motor commands bypass slower diagnostic reads
- **Intelligent Batching**: Groups related motor operations for efficiency
- **Error Recovery**: Continues operation even with temporary communication errors
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents overwhelming the RoboClaw controller

### Legacy Design Integration

The optimizations are based on proven patterns from the legacy roboclaw_module.cpp:

**Adopted Patterns:**
- **Frequency Separation**: Different update rates for odometry vs status reporting
- **Direct Hardware Access**: Minimal abstraction for time-critical operations  
- **Rate Limiting Logic**: Proven algorithms for preventing controller overload
- **Command Batching**: Efficient grouping of related motor operations

**Modern Improvements:**
- **State Machine Architecture**: Better error handling and recovery
- **Safety Integration**: Unified safety coordination across all modules
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time execution time tracking
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns for maintainability

## Safety System

### Multi-Layer Protection
The safety system implements defense-in-depth principles with multiple independent protection layers:

#### Layer 1: Hardware E-Stop
- **Physical Button**: Immediate hardware-level motor disconnection
- **Response Time**: <1ms from button press to motor shutdown
- **Failsafe Design**: Normally-closed contacts, fail-safe on power loss
- **Redundancy**: Multiple E-stop points throughout robot chassis

#### Layer 2: Software E-Stop
- **Performance Monitoring**: Automatic trigger on timing violations
- **Sensor Monitoring**: Battery voltage, current, temperature thresholds
- **Communication Loss**: Automatic E-stop on ROS2 communication timeout
- **Response Time**: <10ms from detection to safety response

#### Layer 3: Inter-Board Safety
- **Cross-Monitoring**: Each board monitors the other's health status
- **Heartbeat Protocol**: Regular "alive" signals between boards
- **Isolation Capability**: Either board can independently trigger system shutdown
- **Response Time**: <50ms for inter-board safety communication

#### Layer 4: ROS2 Safety Integration
- **High-Level Monitoring**: Navigation system safety checks
- **Operator Override**: Manual E-stop from operator console
- **Mission Abort**: Automatic abort on navigation failures
- **Response Time**: <100ms for ROS2-initiated safety responses

### Safety Thresholds

**Battery Safety:**
- Critical Low Voltage: 32.0V (immediate E-stop)
- Warning Low Voltage: 34.0V (return-to-base procedure)
- High Current: 20A (immediate E-stop, indicates short circuit or stall)
- Temperature: >60°C (thermal protection)

**Performance Safety:**
- Critical Module Timeout: >4ms execution time for RoboClawMonitor (indicates performance issues)
- Standard Module Timeout: >2ms execution time (indicates runaway code)
- System Frequency: <70Hz for >3 cycles (indicates system overload)
- Memory Usage: >90% (indicates memory leak or excessive allocation)

**Communication Safety:**
- ROS2 Timeout: >500ms without high-level commands
- Inter-Board Timeout: >100ms without heartbeat signal
- Sensor Timeout: >200ms without critical sensor data

### Emergency Procedures

**Automatic Recovery:**
- E-stop conditions automatically reset when underlying problems resolve
- Graceful system restart without manual intervention when safe
- Progressive re-enablement of functionality based on system health
- Operator notification and approval required for critical system recovery

**Manual Override:**
- Physical reset button for emergency recovery
- ROS2 service calls for controlled system restart
- Diagnostic mode for troubleshooting without full system activation
- Maintenance mode with safety systems active but operational systems disabled
