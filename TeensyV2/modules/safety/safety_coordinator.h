/**

 * @brief Central safety coordination and E-stop management for TeensyV2
 * 
 * Coordinates safety across all system modules and manages E-stop conditions
 * from multiple sources. Provides centralized safety state management with
 * inter-board coordination and graceful recovery mechanisms.
 * 
 * E-stop Sources:
 * - Hardware E-stop button (immediate hardware cutoff)
 * - Software E-stop from ROS2 system
 * - Performance violations (timing, frequency)
 * - Battery critical conditions (low voltage, high current)
 * - Motor fault conditions (overcurrent, runaway)
 * - Sensor failures (critical sensors offline)
 * - Inter-board safety signals
 * 
 * Recovery Logic:
 * - Automatic recovery when transient conditions clear
 * - Manual recovery required for persistent conditions
 * - Graceful degradation for non-critical issues
 * - Full system shutdown for emergency conditions

 * - Monitor hardware and software E-stop signals

 * - Trigger system-wide E-stop when safety is compromised
 * - Coordinate safety state with other Teensy boards

 * - Provide detailed diagnostic information for safety events

 *     // Halt motors and critical systems
