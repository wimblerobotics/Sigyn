TODO list:
RoboClawMonitor -- Add ability to cycle power to clear latching hardware faults (see roboclaw_monitor.cpp TODOs)
Behavior Trees -- Create a single, parameterized Condition Node (e.g., `IsFaultActive`) that takes a `target_fault` input port, instead of creating individual nodes for each fault type.

# Safety System Critical Gaps (from TeensyV2 Analysis)
* [CRITICAL] Enable Safety on Board 3 (Gripper). Set `BOARD_HAS_SAFETY 1` and instantiate `SafetyCoordinator`.
* [HIGH] Fix Inter-Board Communication. Implement `fault_handler` inter-board signaling in `board1_main.cpp`.
* [MED] Sensor Timeout Safety. Ensure sensors trigger `isUnsafe` if they stop updating.
* [FUTURE] Battery Charging Logic: Warning on low charge, E-Stop on Critical Low.

# Multi-Board Safety Coordination (2025-01-06)
* [HIGH] Enable SafetyCoordinator on Board2 and Board3 - Each board needs to send FAULT messages to sigyn_to_sensor_v2
  - Update config.h to ensure BOARD_HAS_SAFETY=1 for boards 2 and 3
  - Verify SafetyCoordinator::getInstance() is called in board2_main.cpp and board3_main.cpp
* [HIGH] GPIO Inter-Board E-Stop Signaling - Implement hardware-level fault propagation
  - Board2 → Board1: GPIO pin signal when Board2 has EMERGENCY_STOP fault
  - Board3 (Elevator) → Board1: GPIO pin signal when Board3 has EMERGENCY_STOP fault  
  - Board1: Interrupt handlers on input pins to immediately raise hardware E-stop
  - Board1: Drop E-stop when all board GPIO signals clear AND no local faults

# Perimeter Roamer V3
* Test with actual robot hardware.
* Implement TF2 integration for proper pose tracking.
* Add current pose monitoring for better space classification.
* Implement wall-following behavior for room patrolling.
* Add obstacle avoidance integration.

# General
* Predict battery discharge time based on current draw.
* Board1 should pick up roboclaw temp, motor1 current, motor2 current.
* Implement heartbeat/watchdog from sigyn_to_sensor_v2.

# IMU
* Detect critical tilt in x or y.
