I'm in the process of rewriting the safety system for this project. The design goals are:
* Multiple faults can set an e-stop.  The system should probably contain an array, indexed by EstopSource of the state of each possible e-stop.
* Each e-stop has a source from EstopSource, a human-readable description of the fault, and the timestamp it was activated.
* e-stops can be active or not. calling activateEstop will activate the e-stop. Calling deactivateEstop will deactivate it.
* When activateEstop is called (i.e., if any of the sources is active), then RoboClawMonitor.setEmergencyStop should be called.
* When the last active estop is cleared via deactivateEstop (i.e. if all the sources are inactive), then RoboClawMonitor.clearEmergencyStop should be called.
* Actually, If the CONTROLS_ROBOCLAW_ESTOP_PIN is true, then you call RoboClawMonitor functions. If false, you call SafetyCoordinator setRemoteEmergencyStop or clearRemoteEmergencyStop which raises/lowers the GPIO pin INTER_BOARD_SIGNAL_OUTPUT_PIN, which should also be initialized to be a GPIO output pin initialized to LOW. Each BOARD may have a different GPIO pin for this but may use the same pin number. If CONTROLS_ROBOCLAW_ESTOP_PIN is true, there should be a set of GPIO pins, one for each of the boards that has CONTROLS_ROBOCLAW_ESTOP_PIN set to false, to receive the remote e-stop signal from those boards. So INTER_BOARD_SIGNAL_INPUT_PIN should be replaced with a set of PINS and a define naming the source board (e.g., Board2, Bpoard3). 
* There should be a SafetyCoordinator:handleRemoteEmergencyStop.
* If CONTROLS_ROBOCLAW_ESTOP_PIN is true, then the board should set an interrupt handler for each of the remote boards that can signal a remote e-stop and handleRemoteEmergencyStop should then call activateEmergencyStop with INTER_BOARD as the source and the name of the board as the description. The inter board faults are intended to be either self healing, though a better scheme for remote fault signaling would be nicer so the remote board could describe multiple kinds of faults. For example Board2 controls the IMUs and has voltage/current monitors, so it would be nice to indicate IMU failure or BATTERY_LOW_VOLATE or new faults for POWER_SUPPLY_24V_FAILURE and also for the 12, 5 and 3.3V power supplies.
* Right now, I've only described e-stop failures. The system should also handle WARNING, and DEGRADED  faults as well, probably having separate arrays for them. A SYSTEM_SHUTDOWN probably doesn't need an array as if it is triggered, the whole system will beging to shutdown, there is no need to deal with multiple sources.
* I will be adding power relays to shut off power to the RoboClaw motor controller as that is sometimes the only way to recover from some faults, and I will add a relay to shut off the main battery power, which will happen if a system fault is detected which will also include the condition of detecting that the main battery voltage is critically low.

I have to leave for a couple of hours. Please do a deep inspection of all the code in TeensyV2 and the related code in sigyn_to_sensor_v2 which communicates with TeensyV2 and suggest changes to the architecture to accomodate my new requirements. Also suggest improvements to how do change the architecture.

Sigyn is a personal robot I am building. I'm evolving the safety system. The robot has a main computer and three Teensy 4.1 microcomputer based boards. The Teensy boards communicate with the RoboClaw motor controller and also with many sensors, such as VL53L0X time of flight, IMU, temperature, voltate/current and so on. The Teensy systems need to coordinate to detect unsafe systems and the ROS2 system running on the PC can also detect unsafe conditions and, via sigyn_to_sensor_v2 pass messages to the Teensy boards. One board, configured as Board1 in config.h, is the enforcer of safety. Board1 can tell the RoboClaw to shutdown the motors via RoboClawMonitor.setEmergencyStop, which is the main way to enforce critical safety. Soon Board1 will also be able to disconnect battery power to the whole system to handle system level faults.

The Teensy systems were originally just going to use GPIO pins to signal faults to each other but I think that may be too limiting. Im thinking now that I need somthing better. Maybe I could use a software UART rather than just raising a pin to signal/clear fault notification from Board2 and Board3 to Board1.

So, please analyze the system, ask qny questions you may have, and propose changes to the architecture , especally to safety_coordinator code.
