Sigyn is a robot built by me. 
The software uses Linux Ubuntu 24.04 and ROS 2 Jazzy. 
It is intended to eventually be an assistant for me as I age. 
I will monitor the house, looking for changes that might be of interest, like things left on the floor, smoke in a room, an unusual temperature, unusual people in the house and so on. 
It will perform physical tasks like fetching items and bringing them to me, cleaning up the house, getting mail, helping me do chores, checking up on me and summoning help and more.

For now, I want to review the safety systems I've built so far.

The robot software is basically broken up into two parts:
* Most of it runs the nav2 stack on a PC computer.
* Other parts run on small microcontrollers or microcomputers. 
Those parts mostly deal with sensors, such as reading time of flight sensors, temperature sensors, voltage and current sensors, talking to the motor controller, dealing with cameras for segmentation analysis and object recognition, working the gripper mechanism to physically manipulate objects.

Right now, I want to examine part of the system and write some documentation. 
The first of the two main packages are TeensyV2 which is software that runs on 3 different custom boards I built that hold a Teensy 4.1 microcontroller. 
Board1 talks to the RoboClaw controller, talks to the 8 VL53L0X time of flight controllers, and reads the two temperature sensors attached to the two motors that provide the differential drive. 
Board 2 reads the voltage and current monitors for the 36 volt, 10s LIPO battery, and the 24, 12, 5 and 3.3 volt brick converters, and also reads the two IMU chips. Board 3 controls the gripper assembly which has an elevator, extender and grasper component.

The seconds of the two main safety packages is sigyn_to_sensor_v2 which converts ROS 2 messages to communication with the various TeensyV2 boards.

The safety system is primarily provided by the TeensyV2 package. In includes the Module component which wraps the normal 'setup' and 'loop' calls in Arduino-like code to provide performance monitoring.  SerialManager manages the communication between each board and the sigyn_to_sensor_v2 package. sd_logger provides logging on each board so that if the system fails I can pull the SD card from any board and get a pretty comprehensive idea about what happened so I can debug it. 

The safe_coordinator module is suppose to be a key component in the safety system. It is intended that the whole software stack deal with safety so that the robot is always trustworthy. The robot should not destroy motors by melting windings, run into things because the software wasn't running compents fast enough or because the robot didn't respond properly to nearby obstacles, recognize that the battery needs charging and lots more.

I want you to do several things now.
1. Of great importance, I want you to really look at and understand the TeensyV2 package and the sigyn_to_sensor_v2 package. No hallucinations, no shortcuts, no making guesses. Read all of the code and understand it. Ask questions if you need help but under no circumstances shortcut this step. You will not be able to help at all if you do not really understand the code.
2. Confirm with me that you have read and understood all the code in those two packages. You understand how ros2 communicates, how the two packages communicate with each other, what the various sensors are for and how they work, and, especially, you understand the safety system code.
3. I want you to generate a document called V2_SAFETY_CRITIQUE.md that discusses what you see are the good and bad parts of the existing safety system code. What does the system seem to do well, what are it's weeknesses. What is fairly well and farily completely implemented and what are the gaps in the implementation.
4. I want you to generate a document called V2_SAFETY_OVERVIEW.md. Use the document SAFETY_SYSTEM_ACTUAL if it helps but that document probably has a lot of errors in it. This document will be read by fairly experienced computer programmers building their own robots. They understand ROS2, C++ and Python fairly well and want to understand what they intent was in my safety system, how I implemented it, what the safety system does and how each software file contributes to the safety system. They should be able to ready this document and use it as a starting point for designing their own safety system.
5. I want you to generate a document called V2_SAFETY_TODO.md which addresses architectural faults you see and how I might address them. Talk about how I could improve the overall safety system so that the robot will be robust, reliable and so I can trust that the robot will likely to do as commanded and will not present a danger to me or the environment. Talk about missing code, or code that is inconsistently implemented. Talk about improvements that I should look at. 

Ask questions as needed until your are farily certain you are up to the task. I am paying for this service, so don't shirk in taking time to do an exceptional job. Do not lie, don't hallucinate.
