I'm going to want to do testing of roboclaw_monitor in two phases: everything that is more or less internal to RoboClawMonitor, and then integration with the safety system.

I'm not sure I have all the safety systems defined or if the code is correct. Examples are motor over run detection and current overrun. Let's not tackle that first. Instead, let's test the other insteresting functions. I don't wan't naive, 100% code coverage testing, but I do want to test important functions. Here I'd like your help for this first pass of testing.

1. Tell me if you agree with this approach.
2. Examing roboclaw_monitor deeply so you understand it. Keep in mind that this is the motor controller formy personal robot, Sigyn. The robot is using ROS2/Jazzy and is running under Linux 24.04. The ROS 2 components run an a PC and the Teensy V2 directory contains code that runs on 3 different custom boards I designed, each having a Teensy 4.1 microcontroller. The package sigyn_to_sensor_v2 is the communication line between the Teensy boards and ROS 2. Board1 is the board that deals with the RoboClaw motor controller device, which is managed by roboclaw_monitor.cpp, and also the 8 VL53L0X time-of-flight sensors and the temperature sensos. Importantly, board1 is the board that controls the e-stop pin to the RoboClaw device which is the critical safety feature. You should understand sigyn_to_sensor_v2 and also safety_coordinator.cpp in this package.
3. Propose a plan for creating tests for roboclaw_monitor in phases. I want to create one or two tests to start to see that the test framework still works, including all of the previous tests that already exist. I want high quality test that people who look at this open source code would agree were a good set of tests and well implemented. I want to at least check if not test that the cmd_vel conversion to motor commands seems correct as well as the code that creates the odom topic and tf transform. I want an analysis of the safety code I've written so far and suggestions for improvements.

It's a big ask, I think, and will take some iterations to get a solid piece of code working and tested.
